Physiological Plasticity in Migratory and Non-Migratory Phenotypes of the True Armyworm Moth (Mythimna unipuncta).

The true armyworm moth, or Mythimna unipuncta, is known for its high mobility and as a North American agricultural pest to grasses such as wheat, oats, rice and barley (Hobson et al., 2012). Females produce up to 2000 eggs when conditions are favourableâ€”the true armyworm can be migratory or non-migratory depending on the environmental conditions during emergence (Hobson et al., 2012). Migratory insects, such as the true armyworm moth, make tradeoffs to optimize the cost of migratory flight with future reproduction (Anparasan et al., 2020).

The objective of this paper is to investigate the environmental conditions that lead to the underlying phenotypically plastic responses in regards to the true armyworm moths. Phenotypical differences between the migratory and non-migratory such as wing ratio, wing loading, thorax mass, circulating lipids in the form of unsaturated FAs and long chain PUFAs, metabolic rates and CS activity was visualized, analyzed and interpreted.

A variety of statistical methods were used to analyze the data. These statistical methods included the Students T-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, post-hoc multiple comparison tests, correlation and linear regression.
